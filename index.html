			<h1>WHAT IS STEM?</h1>
			<p> STEM stand for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematical. This strand Focuses more on mathematics and sciences which we can use for our everyday living. It is important because it interpenetrate every part of our lives. STEM activities provides hands-on and minds-on activities for the students. </p><br>
			<p> At its core, <b>STEM is a teaching philosophy that integrates all four disciplines together into a single, cross-disciplinary program</b> which offers instruction in real-world (as opposed to purely academic) applications and teaching methods.</p><br>

			<h1>STEM programs are a ton of work.</h1>
			<p> Even STEM students who are already gifted in all four disciplines are often challenged by the sheer amount of homework and studying required by each class. These programs are famous for having super heavy workloads, which makes sense as the subjects covered in STEM programs are extremely complex. Being able to adequately understand them requires hours of extra work outside of class.</p><br>
			<p> But it’s not all busy work. STEM students have to be careful that their eyes never glaze over while completing a project, because making mistakes can be costly. STEM students are expected to deliver the highest quality of work—regardless of how much homework they have. Which, again, makes sense if you consider the jobs these students will be doing after they graduate.</p><br>
			<p>If a software developer makes a single error in a piece of code, they can break an important program and cause a company to lose thousands of dollars. Even a tiny miscalculation in a rocket launch can cost lives. So many STEM careers require perfect execution in high-stress environments—it makes sense that a STEM education will require the same thing.</p><br>

			<h1>STEM Opportunities</h1>
			<p>By engaging students to STEM and giving them chance to explore STEM- related concepts they will develop a desire for it and hopefully overtake a job in STEM.</p><br>

			<h1>What can I do with a STEM education after graduation?</h1>
			<p>Technology advances by leaps and bounds seemingly every day. Yet everything from new software to new metal alloys for spacecraft to the discovery of new sources of renewable energy or the cure for a previously incurable disease all need to be produced by someone. And as technology continues to advance, the already high demand for STEM professionals continues to climb.</p><br>
			<p>Going through a STEM program is pretty intense. It requires a lot of dedication, perseverance, and sacrifice to make it all the way through. However, this style of education builds the skills and mindsets that employers find incredibly valuable. And since the demand for STEM professionals is so high, employers in STEM fields are willing to offer some of the most generous starting salaries that recent graduates can get.</p><br>

			<h1>STEM Benifits</h1>
			<p>-It provokes experimentation – technological advancement doesn’t invented if the inventor did not give a little risk-taking to test or establish hypothesis on his/her suspicion.</p>
			<br>
			<p>-It incite teamwork – students cooperate to find solution of a problem.</p>
			<br>
			<p>-Acceptance of failure – students experience to fall and try again. Not every game we win, but sometimes we lose, accepting defeat makes us braver and more positive to continue the battle.</p>
			<br>
			<p>-Critical Thinking – it broadens our knowledge and teach us to apply every situation into our real life.</p>
			<br>
			<p>-Develop Self-Confidence – it boost our moral in taking STEM.</p>
